    * that the list is in chronological order - it is not,
      `get_arrival_parameters_for_train` builds it with `groupby('case_id')`,

    * that one run == one calendar date - a date's arrivals were split across
      several runs whenever the order jumped between weekdays.

    On SEPSIS that reported ~1.15 arrivals/day against a true 2.13. Counting
    per date and then averaging the dates that share a weekday is what the
